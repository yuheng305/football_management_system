# Node.js Backend with MySQL on Azure

## Description

This is a backend application built with **Node.js** and uses **MySQL** as the database. Most of the business logic and operations of the application are implemented and handled through MySQL, where data will be stored and managed. **MySQL** is deployed and hosted on **Azure** to provide scalability and security for the database.

This backend runs locally on **localhost:3001** in the development environment, and it will interact with the MySQL database to process requests.
