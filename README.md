# Football Tournament Information System

## Description

This system is designed to store and manage information about football tournament seasons. It includes detailed records for various entities involved in the tournament, such as clubs, players, coaches, referees, and stadiums.

The system tracks information about the clubs participating in the tournament. For each club, you can retrieve data about the players, including whether they play officially for the club or on loan. The system also stores the duration of these players' contracts with the club, whether as official players or loaned players. Additionally, detailed data about each match during the season, such as match results, goals scored, goals conceded, and overall points, is also stored. Clubs are ranked based on their points, and the number of goals scored and conceded is recorded for every match in the tournament.

Each club is associated with a stadium, and the stadium details include the stadium's name, location, and seating capacity.
